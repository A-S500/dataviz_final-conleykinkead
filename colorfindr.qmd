## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(colorfindr)
```

```{r}
get_colors(
  img = "https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0848%2F7808%2Fproducts%2Fbeyond-polish-opi-nail-lacquer-ecstatic-prismatic-05-oz-nlc78-2_grande.jpg%3Fv%3D1579481905&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=f5caa0c9454e5da183a000425d81268221f13ac3a3dbdfacd0d2e160c84036d0&ipo=images", top_n = TRUE
